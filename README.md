This code lets you create 3 different types of workout splits that each incorporate progressive overload.

The splits this code creates can be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet which you can then tailor to your specific needs.

This allows people of all different types of workout styles to easily figure out which weight to load when doing the 3 main compound lifts (Bench, Squat, Deadlift).

Of course these are all suggestions. The split data is based on research from Muscle and Strength with slight modifications (visit www.muscleandstrength.com for more information).
